                    <p><strong>Gaming has been a significant part of my life.</strong> I picked up my first controller at the age of four, playing on our family's trusty PS2. My father and I would spend hours together playing games like Sly Cooper, Jak and Daxter, and Ratchet and Clank. 
                        I fell in love with console gaming, and during high school, I discovered the world of PC gaming. This new discovery sparked my interest in computers and technology.
                        In ninth grade, I built my first PC and began playing games like Team Fortress 2, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike. 
                        My gaming journey took a significant turn when I discovered Overwatch. This game truly changed my life upon its release. I became deeply immersed in the esports community created by Blizzard Entertainment, competing at some of the highest levels 
                        of the Overwatch Path to Pro program. When I entered college, I joined the University at Albany's Overwatch team and quickly became the co-captain and coach for other students in the program. 
                        I consistently ranked in the top 500 on the North American leaderboard and had the opportunity to travel to Lake Placid, NY, to compete in the first-ever esports tournament for the "Empire State Winter Games"! 
                        When I got hired at IBM as an intern, I was extremely happy to find out that I could participate in the Corporate E-Sports Association! I was able to represent IBM in CEA and ended up winning the tournament for 2022!
                        With that win, we were able to raise $1560 for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals! See below for some of my top picks for the best games I've played as well as some of my achievements in competitive games.</p>

                        <p>A truly genre defining title. This game laid out the formula for the roguelike genre that has you explore a procedurally generated dungeon, fighting off hordes of demons and collecting items that change the way you play the game.</p>
